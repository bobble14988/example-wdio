# Tesco Online Grocery Search

## Requirement Description
User should be able to search for groceries

### Business Justification
- Users were complaining that there was no search feature on the website
- It's a bad user experience to manually navigate to each grocery category to add products to the cart
- Providing a more efficient user experience will:
  - Shorten users interaction on website
  - Increase conversion rate

### Acceptance Criteria

AC1: User should be able to enter text from the main groceries page, click a search button, and see a results page

AC2: The results page should contain results relevant to the user's search

AC3: The results page should be quick to display results

### Quality Assurance

- How will we test each AC?
- How will we ensure each AC continues to work in the future?
- There are over 10,000 groceries sold by Tesco, how will we ensure all searches are successful?
- How do we make sure the results are quick to display?
- How do we make sure all users have a good experience with the search feature?
- When in the SDLC will we test these ACs?
- In which environment should we test these ACs?
- Are there any data considerations?
- How do we inform stakeholders of test results?
